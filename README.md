# Plasmid-Length
Program uses raw reads from Oxford Nanopore sequencing data to estimate plasmid size and creates a subselection of high quality reads of a similar length.

# Input
Uses a fastq file of raw reads from a single plasmid sample. Program is intended to be used with Oxford Nanopore Sequencing Data.

# Output
Creates a fasta file of reads that are of similar length to the predicted length of the plasmid.
